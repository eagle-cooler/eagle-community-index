# Product Context - Eagle Community Index

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The Eagle file management application has a growing ecosystem of community plugins, but lacks a centralized, automated system for:
- Discovering and validating quality plugins
- Maintaining up-to-date plugin information
- Ensuring plugins meet technical standards
- Providing reliable distribution metadata

### Target Users

#### Plugin Developers
- Need clear standards for plugin submission
- Want automated validation and feedback
- Require visibility into index status
- Benefit from standardized release processes

#### Eagle Users
- Need reliable plugin discovery
- Want assurance of plugin quality and safety
- Require up-to-date version information
- Benefit from categorized plugin listings

#### System Administrators
- Need automated maintenance with minimal intervention
- Require audit trails and error visibility
- Want scalable rate-limited operations
- Need blacklist management for problematic repositories

## How It Should Work

### User Journey - Plugin Developer
1. Developer creates Eagle plugin with proper manifest.json
2. Sets up GitHub Actions for automated builds
3. Submits repository to index (via GitHub workflow)
4. System verifies compliance and adds to candidate index
5. Plugin can be promoted to primary index after validation
6. Ongoing updates are automatically tracked

### User Journey - Plugin Consumer
1. Access index files (candidate.json, primary.json, alldex.json)
2. Browse categorized plugin listings with metadata
3. View version history and last update timestamps
4. Access direct links to plugin repositories and releases

### System Behavior
- **Proactive**: Automatically checks for updates on schedule
- **Defensive**: Validates all inputs and handles failures gracefully
- **Transparent**: Provides detailed logging and audit trails
- **Scalable**: Respects rate limits and processes in batches

## Success Metrics
- Repository verification accuracy (>99%)
- Index update reliability (daily successful runs)
- Community adoption (plugin submissions growth)
- System uptime and error recovery
- Developer satisfaction with submission process

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Minimal steps for plugin submission
- **Reliability**: Consistent system behavior and uptime
- **Transparency**: Clear feedback on verification status
- **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention required
- **Trust**: High confidence in plugin quality and safety
