# Active Context - Eagle Community Index

## Current Work Focus

### Recently Completed (September 2025)
1. **Index Update System**: Complete implementation of `update-index.py` and `update-index.yaml`
   - Automated bulk updates for entries older than configurable threshold
   - Rate limiting with 1-second delays between API calls
   - Batch processing with configurable limits (default: 200 entries)
   - Smart filtering to only check entries that haven't been updated recently

2. **Repository Field Addition**: Enhanced index entries to include source repository
   - Added `repository` field to track which GitHub repo each plugin came from
   - Provides complete traceability from index entry back to source
   - Essential for update operations and audit trails

3. **Case Preservation Fix**: Corrected serialized name generation
   - Fixed `_create_serialized_name()` to preserve original case
   - Removed inappropriate lowercase conversion
   - Maintains plugin name casing as intended by developers

4. **Logic Correction**: Fixed update threshold logic
   - Changed from "update entries modified within X days" to "update entries NOT modified for X days"
   - More logical for maintenance operations (check old entries, skip recent ones)
   - Prevents unnecessary API calls for recently updated entries

## Recent Changes

### Technical Improvements
- **Rate Limiting**: Added `time.sleep(1)` between GitHub API calls
- **Logic Inversion**: Corrected days threshold logic for update operations
- **Documentation**: Updated help text and comments to reflect correct behavior
- **Error Handling**: Maintained robust error handling throughout system

### System State
- **Index Files**: Contains one test entry (Eagle.WebDAV plugin)
- **Blacklist System**: Empty but ready for automatic population
- **Workflow Status**: All three workflows complete and functional
- **Cache System**: Implemented in verification workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Testing**: Validate update system with real repositories
2. **Documentation**: Create user-facing documentation for plugin submission
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for workflow failures
4. **Performance**: Monitor rate limiting effectiveness

### Future Enhancements
1. **Parallel Processing**: Consider parallelizing API calls with proper rate limiting
2. **Formal Schema**: Add JSON schema validation for index files
3. **Authentication**: Consider GitHub token for higher rate limits
4. **Metrics**: Add success/failure metrics collection

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Decisions Made
- **Repository Tracking**: Include source repository in all index entries
- **Case Preservation**: Maintain original plugin name casing
- **Update Strategy**: Focus on entries that haven't been updated recently
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative 1-second delays to avoid API limits

### Open Questions
- **Authentication**: Should we use GitHub tokens for higher rate limits?
- **Parallelization**: Can we safely parallelize API calls?
- **Schema Validation**: Do we need formal JSON schema validation?
- **Monitoring**: What metrics should we track for system health?

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns
- **Error Handling**: Always return tuples with success status and messages
- **Timestamp Format**: ISO 8601 with UTC timezone (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.fffffffZ`)
- **API Delays**: 1-second sleep before each GitHub API call
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable limits with sensible defaults

### Workflow Patterns
- **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs before processing
- **Output Capture**: Extract key information for workflow summaries
- **Conditional Commits**: Only commit when actual changes occur
- **Descriptive Messages**: Clear commit messages describing changes

### Data Patterns
- **Atomic Updates**: Read â†’ Modify â†’ Write as single operations
- **Version Management**: Latest version at index 0, historical versions preserved
- **Type Safety**: Careful handling of optional fields and type checking
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintain consistency between alldex.json and type files

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well
- **Modular Design**: Separate scripts for distinct operations
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Workflows provide excellent automation
- **JSON Storage**: Simple, git-friendly data format
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative approach prevents API issues

### Areas for Improvement
- **Error Recovery**: Could enhance failure recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Sequential processing is safe but slow
- **Validation**: Could add more robust data validation
- **Monitoring**: Limited visibility into system health over time

### Key Technical Insights
- **GitHub API**: Base64 decoding required for file contents
- **Timestamp Parsing**: ISO format parsing requires timezone handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative delays prevent most API issues
- **Batch Processing**: Essential for scalability with large plugin catalogs
